# Digital-Clock
Simple Digital Clock

This is a simple and easy understandable code for a Digital Clock.

It includes 3 variables, to store hours, minutes and seconds.
Another variable was added to store a value 1000, which is milliseconds that you will need later in this code.

Then you have a printf and a scanf to set the time you want.

An If statement was added to prevent the user to create invalid time.

After it, you got an infinite While loop to increment the seconds, minutes and hours according to the conditions in the If statement, and after the if statements you have the printf() which is going to print the time to your screen.
And the function Sleep() with the variable we created before with the value 1000 which is going to make the time feel more realistic with 1000 milliseconds delay.

Then you have the system("cls", that will clear the screen.

Hope you like it, and don't forget to follow me ^_^.
